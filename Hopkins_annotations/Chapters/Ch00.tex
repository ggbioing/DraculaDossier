\chapter*{DRACULA\footnotemark}
How these paper have been placed in sequence will be made manifest in the reading of them.
\todo{Also, many documents, ??}%
All needless matters have been eliminated, so that a history almost at variance with the possibilites of latter-day belief may stand forth as simple fact.
There is throughout no statement of past things wherein memory may err, for all the records choosen are exactly contemporary, given from stand-points and within the range of knowledge of those who made them.

\footnotetext{Something - maybe related to your recent inquiries - triggered pre-set ?? in the GCHQ datahouses.
It got me a mailpointing to a certain dossier.
It appears to contain an original version of Bram Stoker's Dracula, annotated by two different hands - The second is using "Van Sloan" and "Cushing" to refer to both.
I'm using, therefore "Hopkins" for myself.
I can't send you the original - to conspicuous if missing - so I've copied most annotations on this copy of the published novel.
There's a lot of fact checking to do, but ??
The events are real, according to Cushing!
